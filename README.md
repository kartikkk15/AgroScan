## 📌 About the Project
AgroScan is built as a fast and focused single-page web tool, optimized for ease of use, mobile access, and zero distraction — perfect for on-field use by farmers and vendors. It allows farmers to generate and download QR codes for their agricultural products. These QR codes contain essential information like:

- ✅ Product Name  
- ✅ Weight  
- ✅ Price  
- ✅ Availability  
- ✅ Farm Location  
- ✅ Contact Information  

The generated QR code can be printed as a **compact label** and attached to the product, enabling consumers to scan and instantly view details.
